 * @param q, pointer to the queue.
 *
 * @return A new queue with the elements in the first and second halves of q
 * interleaved. See example above.

 * @brief Concatenates two queues by adding all the elements in the second queue
 * to the first one. Upon successful exit the first queue will contain the

 * error the two queues will be unchanged.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * Before concatenation: qa = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
 *                       qb = [1, 2, 3, 4]
 *
 * After concatenation:  qa = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 3, 4]
 *                       qb = []
 *
 * @param qa, pointer to the first queue.
 * @param qb, pointer to the second queue.
 *
 * @return OK on success, ERROR if there is any error. In case of error the 
 * contents of both queues must remain unchanged.
