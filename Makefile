# USAGE:
# The code must be organized in the following way:
# - a driver program $(MAIN) which contains the main() function, and runs the desired tests
# - files $(SRC) and headers $(HDR) common to our solution and student submissions
# - file(s) $(FUNCTIONS) containing the functions required in the assignment
# 
# See examples below
#
# Use IFLAGS, LDFLAGS and LDLIBS as needed

# file with main() - driver for test program 
# - different test driver programs can be used by changing this var 

MAIN=main.c

# source files needed for all programs
# SRC=
# header files needed
HDR=stack_fDoble.h reverse.h
# library files needed for all programs
LIBS=libstack_fDoble.a
# source file with additional functions, either our solution or the student solution
FUNCTIONS=reverse.c
